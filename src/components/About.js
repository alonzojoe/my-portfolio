                    <p>Hi, my name is Joe and I am looking for a company where I can continue my career and express my skills in web development.</p>
                    <p>My passion is to build functional web applications using the skills I have self-studied and learned through mentorship.</p>
                    <p>
                    My interest in web development began in 2015, when I was a graduating student in junior high school. Whenever I visited a website, 
                    I was curious about the process behind the user's view, so I chose to study Information Technology in college to learn more about it. 
                    That's where my passion for web development began.
                    </p>
